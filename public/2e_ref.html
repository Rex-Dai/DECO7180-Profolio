    <h1>Final Product Reflections</h1>

    <h2> Achievements from my personal perspective
    </h2>
    <p>
        I felt that the final produced product was in line with the goals set at the start of this project. Some aspects
        needed to be changed, the was omitted, and the didn't work at all, but many parts were successfully designed and implemented, and the
        entire team worked together in the
        . The main aspects of the project that we enjoyed as a team are (1) the information on the timeline are easy to
        understand, distinguishing the categories to which the belongs, and (2) navigating the timeline and POI posters.
        was. Sophisticated and novel, it fits well with the user's vision, which appears in museum exhibits after time
        travel. (3) Aesthetics achieved harmony between WWI style and time travel elements
        , (4) Created meaningful information about the selected time. The period through the record and lesser-known
        information, and (5) Projects is purely implemented by Jerry and me that face frameworks and libraries that we
        have never experienced before and that can be implemented in other thematic areas and may become an integral
        part of our future portfolio or personal page. The greatest dislike of the results was that (1) the experience
        with the selected dataset was frustrating and influenced the demonstration. Many of the entries in the dataset
        were inconsistent or required considerable additional work to make meaningful access to the project. (2) In the
        project, the user could not bookmark the information extracted from the POI poster or dataset. (3) Could not
        implement a fully responsive design.

    <h2> Things that could be better from my personal perspective
    </h2>
    <p>
        A personally unsuccessful aspect of our project and an area we couldn't implement were the family tree builder
        and a useful loading screen. Due to the size of the timeline, and the features and storage requirements that the
        requires, cuts were required in other areas of the project. The family tree creator allowed the user additional
        interactions (creating a family tree by viewing records and uploading photos), but it broke the flow of the
        timeline and restricted the functionality of the timeline. I did. Since the timeline was our core feature, we
        wanted to make sure it was working with the highest potential and thought that the family tree would be cut out.
        However, I would like to implement to add interactions to my project in the future. I tried and implemented
        several different loading screens/animations to tell it was

    <h2>The feedback from tradeshow</h2>
    <p>
        After all, my overall experience at the tradeshow was positive. Our project has been well received by the people
        who interacted with it. Users enjoyed approaching the project, using the navigation system, and getting the
        usage dataset as a central part of the project. However, it is useful to make aesthetic design decisions, how to
        convey how the project was designed for the audience/user group, and that the pitch and poster did not explain
        the aspects of the project as intended. There was feedback. I acknowledged that Our team needed to spend more
        time justifying the decision to include. Discuss and evaluate the aesthetic elements of
        space/time travel and the elements of World War I, how they were designed for viewers, and calls to the dataset
        is POI posters associated with filtered by month and year.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Did not collaborate with other team members well besides Jerry,

                <li> The workload buried us such as we have to individually meet up to debug and code for a lot time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made the product expanded too much in terms of functionality.
                </li>
                <li>Failed to modularize the product, the code became super hard to manage. </li>
