    <h1>Project: Portfolio</h1>

    <p>
        This portfolio is designed to demonstrate the evolution of Time Traveller by using the same timeline pattern.
        The portfolio itself is a very solid proof of how much contribution that I have made to the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of displaying contents by 3D geometries, this portfolio purely uses html pages to display contents. The
        3D
        scenes definitely enhance the immersion for demonstration of contents, which keeps the core functionality that
        exists in Time Traveller - 3D canvas and Camera Traverse function. The content is based on my personal journal
        for documentation at Miro, Miro is my always trustworthy for documentation and easy illustrations and I have been used
        it for a lot of courses and purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future implementation for this portfolio is to include more complex stages or routers to enlarge the information
        flow and type of representation. I always believe 3D development technology are the future directions of
        front-end development.

        If you are interested in this page and implementation, the github page of this project should be good to refer
        to. It is now open sourced at
