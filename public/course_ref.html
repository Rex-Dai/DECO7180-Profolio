    <h1>Course Reflections</h1>

    <p>Generally, Although, I am proud of the work has done by our team, personally I do not feel very great about my
        experiences and materials from this semester due to following
        reasons:</p>

    <h2>Inequality of workloads</h2>
    <p>
        The major problems with our team is that we did not contribute to the project to the same extent. Despite
        the efforts of other members of the team to fix this issue, it was not fixed in the end and it is not very
        likely to solve such problems. Despite
        its success at the tradeshow, this was a disappointing reality and the course itself rarely helped us. And,
        it is somehow inevitable in terms of the nature for developing a really fancy and complex product - U cannot
        count on
        others to work in the same pace as you.
        Our project code is purely finished by me and Jerry, which cost me
        at least 200 hrs to implement and debugging. This time consumption does not even counts all other work including
        documentation and communication etc.
        It turns out I have spent 300 hrs workload for this project and I contributes to all the session while there are
        only two person contributes to the coding.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Experences</h2>
    <p>
        I didn't learn much from the course activities, but I learned a lot by incorporating new technologies into the
        implementation and design of time travellers. So far, my experience with the front end has been limited to basic
        page styles and vanilla JavaScript, not even 3D websites. After completing this project, my programming skills
        have improved significantly. Similarly, I hadn't used React.js and Three.js before this project. By integrating
        this into my project, I was able to learn new frameworks and tools that I could apply to future projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding my learning experience from course activities, I was considerably unimpressed with the course for a
        number of reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the contact activities felt insubstantial. Starting with a ridiculous ice-breaker set a very poor tone
        for the course in my opinion, as it implied the course wasn't taking the students seriously. The following
        activities were more relevant, however, relied on student engagement which was generally low unless
        participation was anonymous. With little to gain in terms of content as we were all drowning in reoccurring
        generic ideas and no way to remember the people we had met, I don't see much value in the activities until
        groups were formed. For this reason, I think we should have been allocated teams as soon as possible.

        I have to say that I felt that the entire workshop time frame was unnecessary. I feel that the content of the
        workshop is divided into (1) referral activities that cover only part of the workshop and (2) activities that
        have little to do with my project. I did. Surprisingly, in addition to the workshops using AJAX, all other
        workshops could be categorized in the second category. Understandably, the participation grade is created so
        that all students have sufficient basic knowledge. But they are not significantly beneficial to me.
    </p>

    <h2>Repeating DocumentationLoads</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout the whole semester, I really found the documentation loads are too heavy as similar contents need to
        be
        validated over and over again.
