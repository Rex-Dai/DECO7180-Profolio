    <h1>2A Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        Overall, I think my 2A design work is satisfying as it conforms to the Design Process pattern that mentioned in
        the lecture. Furthermore, I found my usage of datasets conform the nature of application where people will be
        familiar with searching details of a city inside maps.

            <h2>What I have done well</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Found dataset that uniforms well</li>
                <li>Clear Target Audience</li>
                <li>Feasible Interaction Method</li>
                <li>Good combo between dataset usage and interactions</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dull usage of application, so it is more like a single functionality
                </li>
                <li>
                    Single poster, not rich in terms of 2A assessment
                </li>
            </ul>
