    <h2>Rex Dai, MInfTech Students interested in Full-Stack development</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to assist high school students learn about Australiaâ€™s involvement in WWI, and
        what
        day-to-day life was like in Australia during the war. Based on our group's research and our collective
        experiences
        of static and unengaging online learning during lockdowns over the past 18 months, we wanted to create a
        learning
        supplement that is engaging, novel, and entices users to explore and interact with information. During our
        research into WWI, we found that a lot of resources focus on the battles, conflict, and casualties of the war,
        however, after exploring our chosen datasets, we found that they were rich in information that showed what life
        was like in Australia during the war. This information included newspaper articles, images, and captions that
        portrayed carnivals in West End, dress-up days at hospitals, school-life, butterfly collectors, and girls
        cricket
        teams at local schools.

        While the state library of Queensland datasets do provide an interesting look into day-to-day life during WWI,
        there are gaps in the information that they provide and it is important to acknowledge that. As the dataset is
        based on excerpts from newspapers, the content is subject to any prejudice that the editors and writers may have
        had. Additionally, based on our review of the datasets, there is no mention of First Nations people in the
        dataset
        or their experiences in the war. Therefore, while we do state that we want to teach our users about day-to-day
        life in Australia and Australian experiences in WWI, our datasets do leave out First Nations people and in
        future
        iterations or versions of this concept we would ideally include their views, stories and experiences as well.
