    <h1>About us</h1>

    <p>
      The purpose of our project is to assist high school students learn about Australia’s involvement in WWI, and learn
      about what day-to-day life was like in Australia during the war. Based on our group's research into WWI, and our
      collective experiences of static and unengaging online learning during lockdowns over the past 18 months, we
      wanted to create a learning supplement that is engaging, novel, and entices users to explore and interact with
      information. During our research into WWI, we found that a lot of resources focus on the battles, conflict, and
      casualties of the war, however, after exploring our chosen datasets, we found that they were rich in information
      that showed what life was like in Australia during the war. This information included newspaper articles, images,
      and captions that portrayed carnivals in West End, dress-up days at hospitals, school-life, butterfly collectors,
      and girls cricket teams at local schools.
