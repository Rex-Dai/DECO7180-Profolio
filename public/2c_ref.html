    <h1>Proposal Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        The proposal is not my strength, so I did not perform very well at this stage. My time comes when it comes to
        implementations kind of work.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of overall performance within the team, I think I am at average as there is no really time-consuming
        work at this stage.
    </p>
