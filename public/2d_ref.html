    <h1>Work In Progress Reflections</h1>

    <p>
        In terms of level of complete, our project is overall successful at 2D. At this stage, we have figured out how
        to actually build something in the 3D Canvas from a empty state of project bootstrapped by create react app
        library
        which returns a fresh and good-to-use repository with all the dependencies solved. Due to the work force
        limitations that
        only two person were contributed to the implementation, the current product looks not very pro in terms of
        visualization. There is only a demo usage in the repo.
        Although it might be a natural intuition for developers that the first successful demo(clicking markers to
        successfully
        invoke smooth camera traverse to the poster) is the hardest period for a project, people may prefer to judge the
        level of completeness by how many contents they have seen. The biggest reflection from this stage came from the fact
        that We only got Credit for general progress of 2D.
    </p>
    <p>
        From a developer perspective, I think at this stage the biggest problem of implementation has been solved, what
        actually need to be done is just import and manage 20 of PoI content within runtime. This task is not that hard
        as it is locally rendering by filling the Json file.
