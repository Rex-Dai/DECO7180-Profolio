    <h1>2A Documentation</h1>

    <p>
        Design Inspiration, as the very first stage of this studio. It provides the possibilities that everyone
        coming up there own idea for the future development of studio. Back to the period of doing 2A, I have not gotten
        any significant idea during the contacts, so I refer to Idea tweaker for some inspiration.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the contact of Week2, by using random generation, I got a interesting idea combination with two dataset
        including
    </p>
    <a style=" white-space:nowrap; "
       href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-f8b839ec-e824-49aa-a931-3d03d24c26fe/details?q=">
        Offence Rates—police divisions—monthly from July 2001
    </a>
    <a style=" white-space:nowrap; "
       href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-brisbane-285d2fc2-fddf-4b00-abf7-bb4d82f931f8/details?q=City%20Plan%20v18.00">
        City Plan 2014 — v18.00–2020 — Flood overlay — Overland flow
    </a>
    <p>It suddenly inspired me about what actually I could do with the context of map. My finally design for 2A is the
        product by considering
        about current growing real estate demands of brisbane and the handy usage of Brisbane City Plan dataset
        series.</p>
    <p> Purpose: The Brisbane Living Index is a page that represents the quality of life in a particular suburb or
        region by taking full advantage of the
        JavaScript-based map engine to retrieve and process datasets provided by the Brisbane City Council. Web
        application. Intuitive explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interactive method: This website is designed to be suitable for both responsively designed desktop and mobile
        devices. When a user opens a web page, there is a large card in the center of the page with a title and
        introduction that explains how to use the web page. Clicking or tapping any point in a Brisbane virtual location
        will bring up a small pop-up window showing the calculated index of the specified location and some brief
        descriptions. If you need more detailed information, click on the description and a small box will expand to
        show more detailed static information about the location.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usage of datasets: The five indexes are calculated using records from the Brisbane City Plan
        data source and the crime rate of the department provided by the Queensland Police Service. The method used to
        calculate these indicators is based on several international standards such as the Noise Index, the Wildfire
        Index, and the Air Quality Index. Indexes for which no criteria are accepted are calculated based on the
        percentage of the national ranking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Target Audience: Someone who wants to move somewhere in Brisbane. Living conditions are human primary needs, so
        anyone who wants to find good accommodation can benefit from this aspect. There are many attachments, so those
        who want to buy real estate will be most interested.
